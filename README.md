# Capstone-Project - Concordia Bootcamps

For the final capstone project, I am doing an Exploratory Data Analysis on [Canada Recalls](https://recalls-rappels.canada.ca/en/search/site). The purposes of this project for my Data Science Bootcamps is to

1. practice web scraping using Python and BeautifulSoup
2. explore the library of [Plotly](https://plotly.com/) for data visualization
3. learn data deployment using [Dash](https://plotly.com/dash/) for building an interactive dahsboard (that runs locally)

Due to some technical issue with my Jupyter notebook file, my Data Analysis codes can be read from this [link](https://jovian.ml/ronniekkc/canada-recalls-data-analysis/v/1).


Here is the preview of my dashboard
