# Capstone-Project - Concordia Bootcamps

For the final capstone project, I am doing an Exploratory Data Analysis on [Canada Recalls](https://recalls-rappels.canada.ca/en/search/site). The purposes of this project is to

1. practice my web scraping technique 
2. explore the library of [Plotly](https://plotly.com/) for data visualization
3. learn data deployment using [Dash](https://plotly.com/dash/) for building an interactive dahsboard

Due to some technical issue with my Jupyter notebook file, my Data Analysis can be read from this [link](<iframe src="https://jovian.com/embed?url=https://jovian.com/ronniekkc/canada-recalls-data-analysis/v/1" title="Jovian Viewer" height="800" width="100%" style="margin 0 auto; max-width: 800px;" frameborder="0" scrolling="auto"></iframe>)
