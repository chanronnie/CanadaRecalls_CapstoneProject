# Data Analysis on Canada Recalls

For my final capstone project of Concordia Bootcamps, I am doing an Exploratory Data Analysis on [Canada Recalls](https://recalls-rappels.canada.ca/en/search/site). The purposes of this project for the Data Science Bootcamps program are to

1. practice web scraping using Python and BeautifulSoup
2. explore the library of [Plotly](https://plotly.com/) for data visualization
3. learn data deployment using [Dash](https://plotly.com/dash/) and [PythonAnywhere](https://www.pythonanywhere.com/) for building an interactive dahsboard

## Installation
```
pip install dash
pip install plotly
pip install dash-bootstrap-components
pip install dash-mantine-components
pip install dash-iconify
```
## Requirements
- Python
- BeautifulSoup
- Plotly

## Data Analysis Notebook

⚠️ Since we are not able to view an interactive notebook on GitHub , 
my Data Analysis notebook with interactive graphs can be found in this 👉 [link](https://jovian.com/ronniekkc/canada-recalls-data-analysis) on Jovian platform.
