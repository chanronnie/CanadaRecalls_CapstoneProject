# Capstone-Project - Concordia Bootcamps

GitHub Link: ["Capstone Project-Ronnie"](https://github.com/chanronnie/Capstone-Project)

For the final capstone project, I am doing an Exploratory Data Analysis on [Canada Recalls](https://recalls-rappels.canada.ca/en/search/site). The purposes of this project for the Data Science Bootcamps program are to

1. practice web scraping using Python and BeautifulSoup
2. explore the library of [Plotly](https://plotly.com/) for data visualization
3. learn data deployment using [Dash](https://plotly.com/dash/) for building an interactive dahsboard (that runs locally)

Due to some technical issue with my Jupyter notebook file, my Data Analysis codes can be read from this [link on Jovian platform](https://jovian.com/ronniekkc/canada-recalls-data-analysis).
